# 📊 Predictive Modeling for Life Insurance Cross-Selling

A machine learning project focused on identifying health insurance policyholders who are most likely to buy vehicle insurance. The goal is to assist insurance companies in increasing cross-sell conversions using data-driven strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive model that helps insurance companies identify existing health insurance customers who are likely to purchase vehicle insurance, improving marketing targeting and cross-sell efficiency.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧼 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key trends
- 🤖 Applied multiple **ML models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- ⚖️ **Handled class imbalance** using SMOTE
- 📈 **Evaluated model performance** with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized customer features such as:
- Age, region, vehicle damage status
- Previously insured status
- Annual premium
- Policy sales channel, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)

## 📉 Problem Type

**Binary Classification**  
Target: `Response`  
> 1 → Will buy vehicle insurance  
> 0 → Will not buy

---

## 🧠 EDA Highlights

- Customers with damaged vehicles and no previous insurance are more likely to buy.
- Certain age groups and sales channels show higher conversion.
- Premium ranges help segment potential buyers.
